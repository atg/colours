/**
 * The following is an implementation of the forward and inverse
 * functions for XYZ to JCh values from CIECAM02, as well as a function
 * to return all of J, C, h, Q, M and s.  It has been tested against the
 * spreadsheet of example calculations posted by Mark D.  Fairchild on
 * his website (http://www.cis.rit.edu/fairchild/).
 *
 * This code should be used with XYZ values in 0 to 100, not 0 to 1 like
 * most of my other code uses.  For input from sRGB, I recommend that
 * you use these values: D65 whitepoint, 20% gray, La value of 4 cd/m^2
 * to correspond to an ambient illumination of 64 lux:
 *
 *  la = 4.0;
 *  yb = 20.0;
 *  xw = 95.05;
 *  yw = 100.00;
 *  zw = 108.88;
 *
 *  The f, c and nc parameters control the surround.  CIECAM02 uses
 *  these values for average (relative luminance > 20% of scene white),
 *  dim (between 0% and 20%), and dark (0%).  In general, use average
 *  for both input and output.
 *
 *  // Average
 *  f = 1.0; c = 0.690; nc = 1.0;
 *  // Dim
 *  f = 0.9; c = 0.590; nc = 0.95;
 *  // Dark
 *  f = 0.8; c = 0.525; nc = 0.8;
 *
 * J is the lightness.
 * C is the chroma.
 * h is the hue angle in 0-360.
 * Q is the brightness.
 * M is the colourfulness.
 * s is the saturation.
